In the third Alliance mission (where the elves are escaping from prison) there is a room with three sheep near the middle of the map. When a unit steps on a panel near a sheep, the sheep will say one of three things. Step on the panels to say "Baw, Ram, Ewe" to open a door above them. The door leads to a bunch of flying sheep and a big question mark. Pick up the question mark as if it were an item to unlock a secret tower level.

Sometimes real time strategy games are hard, man. Sometimes you just need an extra push to claim victory - and sometimes you just want to demolish an entire army with one invulnerable Peon. Whatever your reasons, you can check below for a full list of cheat codes for both Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, and Warcraft 3: Reforged - all cheat codes work with both versions of the game.
 
To enter a cheat code, simply hit the enter key to bring up the chat window, type in the code phrase (no spaces, capitalization does not matter) and hit enter again. If successful, instead of seeing your message broadcast, you'll see the words "Cheat Enabled" instead.
 
In the second Night Elf mission in the campaign mode (Chapter 2: Daughters of the Moon) you can find a Hydralisk at the top of the map, slightly to the left of the top right fountain of life. The easiest way to find it is to create an owl scout and fly it up towards the fountain and then move left along the top of the map until you see it. I don't think it is possible to fight it, but it is a nice easter egg for Starcraft fans.
 
You can control it as it will become your ally.. reach as close to it as possible(the area above the log) and you will receive 3 night elf catapults. Use them to cut a path through the trees to the Hydralisk and you will be able to use it.
 
yea loatheb has 5.3 mil HP and the CN reigons cheating bosses doing 9 million dmg to a 5 mil HP boss. Its really annoying being in the top 10 DPS in the world and then a cheating CN group of players cheats and modifies logs and knocks down your ranks. I say Ban those profiles posting those logs and anyone else who posts logs with them in it. Ruin their future logging. Any log with their name in it once a log has been faked or cheated invalid. That should keep them from doing it in the future.

Warcraft Logs - Combat Analysis for Warcraft Clearly that is a modified log. Everyone character involved in that log should be banned from ever ranking in the logs for this. 10.57 mil DMG done to a boss who only has 5.34 mil.
 
I am unable to use the cheatcodes in single player custom game with computer bots as per previous versions. It would be great if the ability to use cheat codes in single player custom games were restored.
 
The cheat codes work in campaign. Not in custom games versus computers.
The difference is: the campaign is single player. Thus is is allowed.
Custom games are considered multi player. Their hosting area is for multiplayer. That you happen to decide to play vs a bot instead of a fellow reforged player is not of relevance there (at least, not for the system).
 
This was the same before reforged. However, before reforged you could play custom games offline, without connection to BNet. Playing vs bots in a single player area. Cheat codes would work here. However, in reforged, you cannot play offline custom games. You can go offline, but going to custom games will crash the client.
 
i played the offline custom games plays fine but the cheat codes dont work. Starcraft 2 if you play offline you can use the cheat codes i did it just 10 minutes ago and they work offline in custom games as long as you have downloaded the map you want to play in offline mode prior to going offline, for example if i wanted to play 4v4 Megaton i make a private lobby for that game, let it download start the map then exit the game once i loaded in disconnect my internet and play it in offline. if fact i just did that to a map called Gold Megaton works fine in offline with cheat code, so they need to do that here exactly that way or if we go offline then we can use it just like in Starcraft 2
 
I also cant get cheats to work in custom games offline, which is the dumbest sheet i have ever heard, im playing by myself i should at least be able to cheat my way through with faster build speeds or extra gold to save time. BLIZZARD CAN YOU FIX THIS BECAUSE WHY THE HELL NOT?

Actually, I believe it does cheat a little bit. Case in point:I was playing Human level 13 (destroy Blackrock Spire) and had wiped out
the northwest band of orcs and had control of the entire eastern edge of
the map. I had my paladins blocking the peons access to the trees and my
flying machines could see that they were just standing around. I also
knew (via flying machines and griffins) that \*nothing\* was close enough
to my paladins to be able to spot them.Now, \*as soon as\* I moved a paladin to unblock the path, the peons
started (and I mean \*immediately\*) to move to the trees. There were no
ogre-mages casting those eye-thingies left, nothing around for \*miles\*
-- yet those peons knew immediately that the way was open. It worked to
my advantage, however, because I left the opening until the peons were
very close then closed it up and killed them all. :)Unless the orcs have something that has a long range visibility (I
haven't played them yet) I'd say this is cheating (or a bug).

 
Say what you like, I \_just\_ saw the computer cheat last night!I played the a multiplayer scenario (isles in the stream?), started with 
with 1 peasant and 1 flying machine.Start:Build town hall, fly to find enemy.
The enemy was also building a town hall. (that's fair)But before I could end mine, he was already building a farm (close to 10
second lead advantage, which is cheating/unfair. BTW, the first thing
I did when the game started was BH right where the peasant stood, so at worst
I would have only a 2 second disadvantage.)Then, the computer started cheating -- before he could even finish the farm,
he started building peons, building barracks, etc. This is cheating since
he doesn't have food!
All in all, I don't mind the minor cheating, we do have the advantage
of intelligence, if given the chance -- i.e., with all games of this class,
they'll mass an army and clobber you because they can build faster than you;
if you can somehow survive the initial onslaught, the rest is just a mop-up
operation because he's out of gold/resources.

Acually, that isn't really cheating as any of your troops can do the same
thing. What acually happens is that the computer player sees that its peons
arne't doing anything, it then tells it's peons to go and cut wood.
The \*computer reality\* then maps a path to the trees and find there is
no way to get there. Opps, so the peons stay where they are. 
Wait a bit says the Computer AI, the peons aren't doing anything, hmm
well I need wood, so he/she sends them to the trees to cut wood, the
\*computer reality\* checks the path from peon to tree, paladin is in the
way so peon stays where he is... Ad infinitum As the computer player can tell his troops to do things a \*lot\* faster
that you can it may seem to be cheating but if you send a unit to a place
they can't get to, they don't go. As a person you may wonder why and
check it. At least I \*think\* that sounds right. As I didn't program
the game I may be right out :-)Share and Enjoy
 
No, there were no ogre-magi to cast them, I had already killed them all
and the Ogre Mound. My flying machines showed no ogre-magi left after
passing over the remaining territory. I hadn't seen a floating eye for
at least 10 minutes and \*not\* at the time I moved the paladin (the
spotting range for an eye is shorter than that of a paladin).
